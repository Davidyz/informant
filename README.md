# informant

An Arch Linux News reader designed to also be used as a pacman hook.

Originally I had wanted to make an interactive pacman hook, but pacman is not
designed to work that way.

## Installation

Requirements are in `requirements.txt`.

## TODO

- write better documentation here
    - probably a man page too
