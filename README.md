# informant

An Arch Linux News reader designed to also be used as a pacman hook.

Originally I had wanted to make an interactive pacman hook, but pacman is not
designed to work that way.

## Installation

You can install from my [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/informant/).

Requirements are in `requirements.txt`. If you want to install it manually.

## TODO

- write better documentation here
    - probably a man page too
- add `--unread` to 'list' subcommand
